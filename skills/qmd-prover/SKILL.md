# qmd-prover

## Running the tool

Every command here runs the `qmd-prover` engine, installed once on the host's `PATH`. This skill
supplies the instructions; the engine is a separate command. Invoke it directly:

```bash
qmd-prover <command> [arguments]
```

If `qmd-prover` is not found, the engine is not installed yet. Install it as a tool once per host,
then it is available in every project:

```bash
# From a checkout of github.com/powergiant/qmd-prover:
npm install -g .        # users — installs the `qmd-prover` command globally
npm link                # developers — same command, backed by your working checkout
```

Installing the skill is a separate, docs-only step. Once the `qmd-prover` command is on your `PATH`,
you never reinstall the engine — `qmd-prover install --global` only **copies the skill documentation**
(`SKILL.md`, the canonical `AGENTS.md` contract and the other files under `references/`, and `agents/`)
into `~/.claude/skills/qmd-prover`. It deliberately excludes the engine itself (`src/` and `scripts/`),
so running it again just refreshes the docs in place. Add `--codex` for Codex; a bare
`qmd-prover install` scopes the copy to the current project instead of the host.

A skill installed mid-session is not auto-registered by the host — read the printed `SKILL.md` path to
use qmd-prover now, and start a new session for automatic discovery.

Run `qmd-prover version` to confirm the install and see the tool, schema, verifier-protocol, and
contract versions it implements. `qmd-prover doctor` additionally reports any version drift between
the engine and the current project (see "Version compatibility" below).

## Version compatibility

The engine and each project carry versions independently: the installed `qmd-prover` implements a
schema, verifier-protocol, and contract version, while a project's `.qmd-prover/` state and its
`AGENTS.md` contract block were written by whatever engine last touched them. When they differ, the
tool prints a `qmd-prover: warning:` line to stderr before running a project command, and
`qmd-prover doctor` lists the same under a `compatibility` array. These are advisory — the command
still runs; the tool never refuses on a version mismatch. Relay a warning to the user and resolve it:

- **schema** — a stale snapshot; it is ignored and rebuilt on the next `qmd-prover inspect project`.
- **verifier-protocol** — affected cached proof decisions are re-verified on the next inspection.
- **contract** — the project's `AGENTS.md` managed block predates the engine's; review the difference
  and, only with user approval, run `qmd-prover init --sync-contract` (see "Project setup").

## Project setup

When the user asks to initialize qmd-prover in the current project, run this from the project root:

```bash
qmd-prover init
```

Read the returned `existing` inventory. If the status is `intent-required`, summarize the detected `AGENTS.md`, QMD files, Quarto configuration, `.qmd-prover` state, and external-policy mode, then ask whether the user wants to adopt the files in place, inspect them first, or leave them unchanged. Run `init --adopt-existing` only after the user chooses adoption.

If the status is `append-required`, explain that existing project policy will be preserved and ask before running `init --append-contract`. If it is `sync-required`, report the current and canonical contract versions and ask before running `init --sync-contract`. Never use a mutation flag without explicit approval. For `already-initialized`, report that setup is current and continue from the user's requested task. No QMD scaffold or initial theorem is required.

Stop and ask before creating, appending, or synchronizing project policy.

## Project contract preflight

Before drafting mathematics, changing qmd-prover state, or relying on a project fact:

1. Read the project's root `AGENTS.md` and this skill's [canonical project contract](references/AGENTS.md).
2. Compare the `qmd-prover-contract` managed blocks byte-for-byte. Require the project block to be present at the same version and unchanged. Obey project-specific rules outside it.
3. Read `.qmd-prover/.external.qmd` when present. Absence permits external results subject to precise hypothesis checks; whitespace-only permits none; nonempty content permits only what it states.
4. If policy is missing, different, malformed, or conflicting, stop before mutation and ask whether the user wants to create or synchronize it. Never change project policy without approval.
5. Reuse a successful comparison only for the same unchanged agent/project context: the project, branch or worktree, contract, and external policy must all remain current. Every independent agent performs its own preflight.

Run the tool from the project root:

```bash
qmd-prover <subcommand> [arguments]
```

Requirements and conventions:

- **Node.js 20+ and Pandoc are required.** Point qmd-prover at Pandoc through `PATH`, `QMD_PROVER_PANDOC`, or `tools.pandoc` in config.
- **Decide the verifier up front.** To have proofs independently checked, set `verification.backend` to `claude` or `codex` before your first inspection (see "Environment and verifier setup" below); under `backend: none` every proof stays unverified.
- **Quarto is optional**, needed only when final rendered output is requested.
- Run `doctor` first when tool availability is uncertain.
- JSON is the default output; the commands marked below also accept `--print` for a concise human report.
- Semantic IDs accept either `@ID` or bare `ID`; output normalizes them to `@ID`.

```

Use `help COMMAND...` for exact filters, status values, ranges, side effects, and failure semantics. Only the commands shown with `[--print]` accept it; `init`, `verification list`, `verification show`, and `render` emit JSON only. `dependency search` matches every fact when `QUERY` is omitted, so its filters can be used on their own. A dependency query returns only its own answer (target, dependencies, path, matches, and so on) as compact fact references; add `--graph` to any `inspect` command when the whole dependency graph is wanted. `render` writes nothing when project errors exist unless `--allow-errors` is explicit.

Read [references/cli.md](references/cli.md) when configuring Pandoc or the verifier, troubleshooting command behavior, installing the skill, or needing the full command inventory.

## Environment and verifier setup

Run `doctor` first: it reports Node, Pandoc, the optional verifier, and Quarto, plus the exact path it resolved for each. Configure anything it reports missing entirely through `.qmd-prover/config.yml` (or environment variables) — you never edit qmd-prover's own code. Every `.qmd-prover/config.yml` setting is documented in [references/config.md](references/config.md).

- **Pandoc (required) and Quarto (optional for final render).** If `doctor` reports either as unavailable, install or download it, then record its path under `tools:` so every later command finds it:

  ```yaml
  tools:
    pandoc: /absolute/path/to/pandoc
    quarto: /absolute/path/to/quarto
  ```

  `QMD_PROVER_PANDOC` and `QMD_PROVER_QUARTO` also work and take precedence. Leave a value blank to fall back to `PATH`.

- **Independent AI verifier.** As an early step, decide whether proofs will be independently checked. Run `doctor`; if you intend to verify and it shows no verifier, set a backend in `.qmd-prover/config.yml` before your first inspection:

  ```yaml
  verification:
    backend: claude        # or: codex
    executable: ""         # path to the claude/codex CLI; blank uses PATH
    model: ""              # "" lets the CLI use its own default model
  ```

  Leaving `backend: none` is a deliberate machine-only choice — local checks stay `not-run` and global states stay unverified; never present that as verified work.

  qmd-prover ships the `claude` and `codex` adapters, so no external verifier script is needed. The selected CLI must be installed and authenticated (an API key or a completed interactive login in this environment). Re-run `doctor` until the verifier reads `available`, then `inspect` calls it automatically. For a bespoke verifier, set `backend: command` with a `verification.command` argv, or point `QMD_PROVER_VERIFIER` at an executable that speaks the stdin/stdout protocol in [references/cli.md](references/cli.md).

Only a configured, available verifier produces verification state. Never declare your own work verified.

## Proof-development layout

Every QMD file in the project is semantic mathematics in one unified dependency graph. qmd-prover registers and protects `thm-main-* .theorem .goal` blocks wherever they appear; their statements are locked and must never be edited. A goal with no proof yet is simply open — proving it needs no setup step.

Write new agent-created definitions, intermediate results, proof attempts, calculations, examples, counterexamples, and progress notes in ordinary project QMD files, by convention under a `workspace/` folder in the project root. Folders are organizational only, never a semantic boundary: organize `workspace/` by theme, by goal, or flat, as the argument demands, and follow any folder principles in local project policy. Edit pre-existing user files cautiously. Put the linked proof of a main goal in a proof overlay file such as `workspace/main-proof.qmd` without repeating the protected theorem, and never copy a proof or the engine-written `status` attribute into a protected statement.

Follow the complete declaration, proof, import, and export rules in the canonical contract. An `@id` citation is a dependency but does not grant cross-file scope. Cite the defining `@def-id` of any non-standard term at its first load-bearing use; the `verification.citations` setting governs how aggressively the verifier flags an uncited non-standard term, and `verification.rigor` (with `verification.rigor-disprove` for a proposed refutation) sets how completely each step must be justified. Keep every explicit ID globally unique across the project. Any fact may cite any other project fact, including a protected main goal, subject to import scope; global composition keeps dependents blocked until the cited fact is globally verified.

Follow every unproved dependency instead of treating it as established. Read the three separate inspection layers: `mechanical` describes machine structure, `local_verification` says only whether the submitted proof follows conditionally from its direct dependency statements, and `global_verification` composes the whole upstream closure. Use a fact as a premise only when its global status is `verified`. These are informal AI-review states, not formal verification, human review, or permission to weaken protected statements.

## Using the infrastructure

Do not impose a fixed proof loop. A request may concern one theorem, a family of results, an existing development, or an idea that first needs precise formulation. Decide which definitions, lemmas, propositions, theorems, examples, or counterexamples to develop and in what order.

After each coherent semantic-QMD edit, use the narrowest relevant operation:

```bash
qmd-prover inspect fact @ID
qmd-prover inspect path PATH
qmd-prover inspect project
```

Fact and path inspection check only selected facts and their transitive local dependencies. Use `inspect project` for deliberate whole-project audits: it compiles every project QMD into one graph and checks every fact.

Repair every mechanical diagnostic and every local-verifier critical error or gap. Set up the verifier before relying on global results (see "Environment and verifier setup"): until one is configured, the graph is still built but local checks stay `not-run` and every global result stays unverified. Machine-only mode is a supported, deliberate choice — not a default to drift into, and never work you may call verified.

Use dependency operations to inspect the project graph, search facts, show paths and cycles, calculate impact, and locate proof frontiers. A duplicate explicit ID is a structural error and must be renamed before dependency analysis can proceed.

## Status and rendering

- Workflow state lives in attributes on the `.proof` div, never in body prose. A proof div is a candidate checked by default; add `.disproof` to make it a proposed counterexample or refutation (checked in refutation mode), or `.abandon` to detach it from its result and keep it only for memory (never checked). Definitions cannot carry `.disproof`.
- A local disproof is conditional on its direct dependencies and becomes globally disproved only when the complete upstream closure is globally verified. A verifier may also discover a refutation while checking an ordinary candidate.
- After a check, the engine projects the fact's LOCAL verdict into a display-only `status` attribute (`verified` or `rejected`) on its div. It is excluded from every content hash, the verifier packet, the cache key, and the snapshot identity, and is never read back — so it never changes what is checked. Never hand-write it; read global state from a command instead.

### Every status a fact can carry

A fact's `status` field summarizes two families. Before a conclusive check it shows a **machine status** derived from the QMD and the dependency graph; once checked (or once its mechanical layer fails) it shows a **verification outcome**.

| `status` | Family | Applies to | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `candidate` | machine | theorem-like with an active proof; every definition | Has content to check, awaiting a local verdict. |
| `open` | machine | theorem-like only | No active proof yet — none written, or the only one is `.abandon`ed. |
| `disproof-candidate` | machine | theorem-like only | Its active proof carries `.disproof`; awaiting a refutation check. |
| `abandoned` | machine | theorem-like only | The proof is detached with `.abandon`; intentionally not checked. |
| `missing` | machine | graph node | Cited by some fact but never declared — an unresolved dependency. |
| `verified` | outcome | any | Mechanically valid, the local proof was accepted, and the entire dependency closure is globally verified. |
| `disproved` | outcome | theorem-like only | A refutation (authored `.disproof` or verifier-discovered) was locally confirmed and its dependency closure is globally verified. |
| `blocked` | outcome | any | The local proof or refutation was accepted, but some dependency is not yet globally verified (see its `blockers`). |
| `rejected` | outcome | any | The verifier rejected the submitted proof or refutation. |
| `unverified` | outcome | any | Mechanically valid, but no local verdict was produced — no verifier configured, or the fact was outside the checked selection. |
| `invalid` | outcome | any | The mechanical layer failed: a shape/date/ID error, an unresolved or out-of-scope reference, or a dependency cycle. |

A **definition** always has a construction to check, so it is `candidate` until checked and can only reach `verified`, `rejected`, `blocked`, `unverified`, or `invalid` — never `open`, `abandoned`, `disproof-candidate`, or `disproved`. Only a **theorem-like** result (theorem, lemma, proposition, corollary) uses the other states.

### How to check a fact's status

Run the narrowest inspection that covers what you need:

```bash
qmd-prover inspect fact @ID      # one fact and its transitive local dependency closure
qmd-prover inspect path PATH     # every fact declared under a file or folder
qmd-prover inspect project       # every fact in the project
```

Each fact reports three independent layers — read all three, because passing one does not imply passing another:

- `mechanical` — machine structure only (shape, IDs, dates, imports, references, cycles, statement locks). Never consults an AI verdict.
- `local_verification` — the conditional check of the submitted proof or refutation against its direct dependency *statements* (assumed true, their own proofs never inspected): `verified`, `rejected`, `disproved`, `not-run`, or `error`.
- `global_verification` — composes the whole upstream closure into the final outcome above; its `blockers` name the dependencies that are not yet verified.

The single `status` field is the summary of these. For mathematical truth read `global_verification.status`, never `ok` (which reports only whether the operation and verifier ran without infrastructure errors). Use a fact as an established premise only when its global status is `verified`; a `disproved` fact is evidence about a false statement, not a usable dependency. To survey many facts at once, `dependency search --status STATUS` filters the published graph by any value in the table (`help dependency search` lists them), and `verification list` / `verification show` read the retained local verdict records.
- Exact local verified, disproved, and rejected outcomes are cached by the target statement, submitted proof or refutation, direct dependency statements, semantic context, external basis, checker contract, and protocol. Dependency proof text and verification state are excluded; changing only an upstream proof triggers global recomposition rather than downstream AI calls.
- `check staleness` is a read-only audit of verification caches against current sources, the external basis, and the checker contract. It never edits QMD.
- Use `verification list` and `verification show` to discover and read retained verification records.
- Use `render` to prepare generated QMD status data and a dependency graph. Use ordinary `quarto render` for final HTML, PDF, or other output.
