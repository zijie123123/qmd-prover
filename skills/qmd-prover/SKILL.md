name: qmd-prover
description: Initialize and inspect semantic-QMD mathematical projects; formulate definitions and results from ideas; develop, independently verify, repair, report, and render proofs. Use when a user asks to initialize qmd-prover, state or prove one or more results, grow a mathematical development, inspect dependencies or progress, submit or review a candidate, revoke an accepted proof, or render theorem navigation.

# qmd-prover

## Project setup

When the user asks to initialize qmd-prover in the current project, run this from the project root:

```bash
node "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/qmd-prover/scripts/qmd-prover.mjs" init-project
```

Read the returned `existing` inventory. If the status is `intent-required`, summarize the detected `AGENTS.md`, QMD files, Quarto configuration, and `.qmd-prover` state, then ask whether the user wants to adopt the files in place, inspect them first, or leave them unchanged. Run `init-project --adopt-existing` only after the user chooses adoption.

If the status is `append-required`, explain that existing project policy will be preserved and ask before running `init-project --append-contract`. If it is `sync-required`, report the current and canonical contract versions and ask before running `init-project --sync-contract`. Never use any mutation flag without explicit approval. For `already-initialized`, tell the user setup is already complete, summarize existing project material, and ask whether to continue it, inspect it, or change local policy. A successful `created`, `adopted`, `appended`, or `synchronized` result completes setup; no QMD scaffold or initial theorem is required.

## Project contract preflight

Before drafting mathematics, changing project files or state, creating a proposal, or submitting a proof:

1. Read the project's root `AGENTS.md` and this skill's [canonical project contract](references/AGENTS.md).
2. Compare the `qmd-prover-contract` managed block in the project file with the canonical block. Require the managed block to be present, at the same version, and unchanged. Allow project-specific rules outside the managed block; obey those rules in addition to the canonical contract.
3. If `AGENTS.md` is missing, the managed block is missing or different, or another project rule conflicts with it, stop before any mutation. Explain the exact issue and ask whether the user wants to create or synchronize the contract. Never create, replace, or synchronize `AGENTS.md` without user approval.
4. Reuse a successful comparison for the current agent in the same project context. Do not reread the files before every QMD read. Repeat the preflight only when the project, branch, worktree, agent context, or `AGENTS.md` may have changed, or when prior completion is uncertain.

Every independent worker must perform this preflight for itself because workers do not share context. Treat a successful preflight as a prerequisite for proof work, not as a compiler check.

Run the dispatcher from the project root:

```bash
node "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/qmd-prover/scripts/qmd-prover.mjs" <subcommand> [arguments]
```

## Using the infrastructure

Do not impose a fixed proving workflow. A request may concern one theorem, a family of results, an existing mathematical development, or an idea that first needs precise formulation. Decide which definitions, lemmas, propositions, theorems, examples, or counterexamples to develop and in what order.

Use the supplied tools when they help:

- initialize or compare the project contract;
- inspect a fact, path, project, workspace, or dependency graph;
- search available mathematics and unresolved frontiers;
- create a persistent noncanonical workspace for one result, related results, or an evolving theory;
- check staleness before relying on `VERIFIED` mathematics;
- submit a linked proof or a new declaration with its linked proof for mechanical and independent AI checking;
- inspect rejection feedback and retry after repairing every critical error and gap;
- promote accepted mathematics through the protected atomic path; and
- render status, dependency, or ordinary Quarto views.

Whenever writing QMD, follow the canonical block discipline. Never redefine a protected result in a proposal, treat a candidate workspace claim as established, edit a canonical proof directly, or declare your own work verified. Only a `correct` verdict with no critical errors or gaps is accepted. Treat `verified`, `formally verified`, and `human reviewed` as distinct states.

## Status and rendering

- Run `check-staleness` before relying on verified mathematics; it removes stale `VERIFIED` markers transitively and reports each invalidation path.
- Use `inspect-project` for all goal states and diagnostics.
- Use `inspect-theorem` for a bounded target/dependency/history bundle.
- Use `inspect-path` for one QMD file or folder, and `dependency frontier`, `dependency search`, or the other dependency queries to work from the latest named graph snapshot.
- Use `verification show` for the complete stored report.
- Use `render` to prepare a generated QMD status page, report data, and a dependency graph; use ordinary `quarto render` for final HTML, PDF, or other output.
- Use `verification revoke @thm-ID --reason "..."` only with a concrete recorded reason.

Translate dispatcher JSON into natural language for the user. Do not make the user learn these commands.

Read [references/cli.md](references/cli.md) only when configuring a parser or verifier, troubleshooting command behavior, or installing the skill.
