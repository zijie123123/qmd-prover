# Proving utilities design

## Role

The proving utilities help Codex or Claude Code turn mathematical reasoning
into a checked proof candidate and move an independently accepted candidate
into canonical QMD safely.

They do not form a proving agent. The host agent decides how to reason, which
lemmas to introduce, when to explore examples, and how to repair a proof. The
utilities provide bounded context, mechanical checks, independent verification,
and a protected acceptance path.

## Proof-development loop

The skill instructs the host agent to repeat:

```text
inspect target
    -> reason and draft outside canonical QMD
    -> check candidate structure
    -> independently verify
    -> repair on rejection or accept safely
```

The loop ends when the selected goal is verified, precisely refuted, genuinely
blocked, cancelled, or explicitly stopped by the user.

## Goal-scoped agent workspace

Proof development takes place in a persistent workspace associated with the
target theorem, not in the canonical Quarto sources. This matters when one
short user-given statement expands into a large body of agent-generated
mathematics.

For example, work on `@thm-main-uniform-index` may eventually contain:

```text
.qmd-prover/workspaces/thm-main-uniform-index/
├── workspace.json
├── target.qmd
├── progress.qmd
├── context/
│   └── imported-results.qmd
├── reductions/
│   ├── reduce-to-strata.qmd
│   └── specialization.qmd
├── local-theory/
│   ├── local-class-groups.qmd
│   └── exponent-bounds.qmd
├── attempts/
│   ├── main-0001.qmd
│   └── main-0002-repaired.qmd
├── dead-ends/
│   └── uniform-generator.qmd
└── proposals/
    ├── lem-local-exponent-bound.qmd
    └── thm-main-uniform-index.qmd
```

`target.qmd` preserves the assigned statement and `workspace.json` records the
canonical identities on which the work began. The other QMD files are
noncanonical working mathematics. They may contain proposed definitions,
lemmas, theorems, examples, or alternative proof routes.

The inspector maintains a provisional dependency graph for this workspace. A
workspace result may depend on verified canonical results or other workspace
claims, but a conjectural claim cannot silently become an accepted premise.
The agent follows unproved edges until it closes the required dependency
closure, replaces a failed claim, or records a genuine dead end.

The directory layout inside a workspace may grow with the proof. It should
group coherent mathematical developments rather than create one file for every
transient thought. Resuming agents use `progress.qmd`, the graph, previous
attempts, and verifier reports to recover the proof frontier.

## Preparing a candidate

The host agent begins from the inspector's bounded theorem context. A utility
may create a proof scaffold linked to the canonical result by semantic ID. The
statement is not copied into each attempt, so the agent cannot accidentally
rewrite protected content while drafting a proof.

A proposal for an existing result contains one `.proof` block with an `of`
attribute. A proposal for a new intermediate result contains one result block
and its linked proof block. Proposals are stored outside canonical QMD while
they are developed. Supporting calculations or search notes may accompany
them, but are not submitted as proof text.

Useful assistance may include:

- showing verified premises available in the theorem's scope;
- searching local semantic results by ID, title, or statement text;
- explaining which import would make a cross-file result available;
- comparing a draft with the protected canonical statement;
- checking every semantic reference in a proof for availability and status;
- retrieving earlier rejected attempts and concrete repair feedback.

These are aids to the host agent. They do not synthesize an autonomous work
plan or maintain a qmd-prover worker model.

### Example proposal

Starting from an open goal, the host agent writes only the proof in an isolated
`proposal.qmd`:

```markdown
::: {.proof of="thm-main-even-square"}
Let \(n\) be even. By @def-even-integer, there is an integer \(k\) such
that \(n=2k\). Hence \(n^2=(2k)^2=4k^2\), so \(4\mid n^2\).
:::
```

The utility obtains the exact title and statement from canonical QMD. The
reference to `@def-even-integer` is the proof's dependency declaration. This
file becomes eligible for acceptance only after preflight and independent
verification.

## Candidate preflight

Before independent verification, the utility confirms that:

- the proposal contains exactly one proof and at most one new result;
- the proof's `of` attribute resolves to its canonical or proposed result;
- an existing target's protected result block was not redefined;
- the proof body is nonempty;
- every dependency exists and is available through local scope or an explicit
  import; and
- every premise required to support an accepted proof has the required
  verification status.

Preflight establishes that the candidate is eligible for mathematical review.
It does not imply correctness.

### Example preflight failure

If the proposal links its proof to a nonexistent or misspelled target:

```markdown
::: {.proof of="thm-main-even-squares"}
Let \(n=2k\). Then \(n^2=4k^2\).
:::
```

preflight rejects it because `@thm-main-even-squares` does not exist. The host
agent must link the proof to `thm-main-even-square`. There is no duplicated
statement in the proposal to edit or compare.

## Independent verification

The verifier is a bounded facility within the proving utilities. It may run an
external command, a fresh LLM context, a host-provided verification sub-agent,
or a formal checker adapter.

An informal verifier receives a minimal packet containing:

- the exact target statement;
- the candidate proof;
- dependencies cited in the proof;
- the statements of cited, verified results;
- relevant definitions and hypotheses; and
- a verification rubric requiring explicit errors and gaps.

It does not receive the proving agent's confidence, private reasoning,
persuasive commentary, or unrelated project narrative. A fresh verifier
context prevents the candidate's author from implicitly self-verifying.

The verifier returns structured results with at least:

- a verdict;
- a short summary;
- critical mathematical errors;
- unfilled gaps; and
- repair guidance.

An informal candidate is accepted only when the verdict is correct and both
the critical-error and gap lists are empty.

LLM verification, formal verification, and human review are separate statuses.
The record must not describe an informal verifier result as formal proof.

### Example verifier packet

An abbreviated packet for the proposal above could be:

```json
{
  "target": {
    "id": "thm-main-even-square",
    "statement": "For every even integer n, n^2 is divisible by 4.",
    "proof": "Let n be even. By @def-even-integer ...",
    "cited_dependencies": ["def-even-integer"]
  },
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "id": "def-even-integer",
      "statement": "An integer n is even if n=2k for some integer k.",
      "status": "verified"
    }
  ],
  "verification": {
    "fresh_context": true,
    "require_zero_gaps": true
  }
}
```

It contains the mathematical context needed for judgment, but no statement
that the author is confident or that a previous attempt almost passed.

## Rejection and repair

On rejection:

- canonical QMD is unchanged;
- the candidate and complete verifier report are retained;
- the host agent reads every critical error and gap;
- repair occurs in a new or updated isolated proposal; and
- the repaired candidate is checked and verified again in a fresh context.

The utility does not hide earlier reports or replace them with a summary that
loses actionable detail.

If the statement appears false, the host agent preserves it and develops a
precise refutation or counterexample for the user. It must not weaken the
statement to manufacture an acceptable proof.

### Example rejection and repair

For the claim “the product of two positive numbers is positive,” suppose a
candidate merely says “This is obvious.” A verifier can respond:

```json
{
  "verdict": "incorrect",
  "summary": "The conclusion is asserted without using the ordered-field rule.",
  "critical_errors": [],
  "gaps": ["Justify why a>0 and b>0 imply ab>0."],
  "repair_hints": "Cite the verified positivity-under-multiplication result."
}
```

The host agent then cites the available lemma at the point of application and
resubmits. A successful second report might be:

```json
{
  "verdict": "correct",
  "summary": "The cited ordered-field lemma directly proves the claim.",
  "critical_errors": [],
  "gaps": [],
  "repair_hints": ""
}
```

The first rejection remains recorded; it is not rewritten as a successful
attempt.

## Safe acceptance

Verification can take time, so acceptance must confirm that the verified
context is still current.

Before verification, the utility records identities for:

- the target statement and existing canonical proof; and
- every dependency statement, proof, and verification status used by the
  candidate.

After a successful verdict, it reinspects the project. If the target or any
dependency changed, the submission is stale and must not be applied.

For a current submission, the utility:

1. acquires the canonical-write lock;
2. replaces only the permitted proof content;
3. records verification for the exact accepted statement and proof;
4. rebuilds and checks the semantic project state; and
5. commits the files atomically, rolling back on any failure.

The host agent cannot bypass this path merely because it authored the proof.

### Example stale acceptance

Assume the verifier accepted a proof using `@lem-bound` with statement hash
`sha256:A`. Before the acceptance write, another edit changes that lemma,
producing statement hash `sha256:B`.

Even if the changed lemma remains true, the verifier did not review the
candidate against that exact dependency. The proving utility reports the
submission as stale and leaves canonical QMD unchanged. The host agent must
inspect the new dependency context and submit again.

By contrast, an unrelated prose edit outside all semantic blocks does not
change the target or dependency identities and need not invalidate the
submission.

## Records

The proving utilities may retain under `.qmd-prover/`:

- persistent goal-scoped workspaces containing agent-generated QMD;
- isolated proposals and optional supporting notes;
- the bounded packet sent to the verifier or its stable identity;
- complete verifier reports;
- accepted and rejected submission records; and
- a verification index relating an exact proof to its status.

This is mathematical working state and proof provenance, not an agent runtime.
The core design has no qmd-prover worker registry, scheduler, or inter-agent
message store. Codex or Claude Code owns the running agent; qmd-prover preserves
the goal workspace that agent reads and writes.

## Invocation model

The utilities are dependency-free Node programs shipped inside the skill. The
skill tells the host agent which script operation to run and how to interpret
its stable JSON result. A human may run the same operation with `node` for
debugging or direct use.

There is no separately installed qmd-prover binary and no independent CLI
architecture. Script command names and JSON schemas are the tool protocol used
by the skill.

### Example direct invocation

From the mathematical project root, a maintainer can submit the isolated
proposal with:

```bash
node "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/qmd-prover/scripts/qmd-prover.mjs" \
  submit-proof .qmd-prover/proposals/even-square.qmd
```

A rejected JSON response directs the host agent to the stored report. An
accepted response identifies the exact target and verification record that now
matches canonical QMD.
