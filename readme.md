# qmd-prover

qmd-prover is a Codex skill and dependency-free Node runtime for disciplined mathematical proof workflows in Quarto Markdown. Canonical mathematics remains readable QMD; goal workspaces, verification reports, and generated Quarto observability inputs stay under `.qmd-prover/`.

## Repository layout

```text
skills/qmd-prover/
  src/               canonical TypeScript runtime source
  scripts/           dependency-free compiled Node runtime
  references/        installed project contract and CLI reference
tests/               TypeScript compiler, verification, concurrency, and rendering tests
tooling/             TypeScript development and installation tools
docs/                maintainer design and architecture documentation
```

The skill package contains its own `SKILL.md`, UI metadata, references, TypeScript source, dispatcher, and compiled runtime. It can be copied independently of the rest of this repository. TypeScript tooling is development-only; installed runtime code has no package dependency.

The supported dispatcher is `scripts/qmd-prover.js`; a generated `scripts/qmd-prover.mjs` launcher remains for compatibility with existing installations.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or later
- Pandoc on `PATH`, or `QMD_PROVER_PANDOC` pointing to a compatible executable
- An independent verifier configured through `QMD_PROVER_VERIFIER` or `.qmd-prover/config.yml`

## Install

```bash
npm run install:skill
```

This installs `skills/qmd-prover/` into `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/qmd-prover`.

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

The test suite uses an AST-producing Pandoc adapter and fresh-process mock verifiers, so it does not require production Pandoc or verifier credentials.

For a faster compile-only check while editing:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```
